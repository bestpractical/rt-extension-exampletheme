NAME
    RT-Extension-ExampleTheme - Example Theme Extension

DESCRIPTION
    RT::Extension::ExampleTheme is a small example of the customizations
    users can make to change the look and feel of RT. These changes are
    saved as a theme for others to use.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.2, 4.4

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm Add this line:
            Plugin('RT::Extension::ExampleTheme');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    To set this theme as the default RT theme (optional), add the following
    line to your RT_SiteConfig.pm

        Set( $WebDefaultStylesheet, ('example-theme'));

    Individual users can also select the theme they want on their
    preferences page.

EXAMPLE CONTENT
    This extension provides some examples of ways to customize the style of
    RT. You can find more information in the RT Style Documentation
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/customizing/styling_rt.html>.

  CSS
    To change the appearance of RT, you can modify any CSS files you copy
    from one of RT's base themes. In addition to copying and modifying the
    CSS set by RT, you can add your own and even do things like hide parts
    of the RT UI. See static/css/example-theme.css for an example of hiding
    the "Priority" field.

  Javascript
    RT uses jQuery, which provides many tools to modify the RT UI via
    javascript. To see an example of changing a label with jQuery, see
    static/js/example-theme.js, which changes "The Basics" on the ticket
    display page to "Ticket State". The trickiest part is often getting the
    selector right.
